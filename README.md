<b>Figure 1.</b> Summary of the three major steps in this research. Step 1: Face representation using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and mask deployment. Step 2: Development of a flow network. Step 3: Application of an analytical flow model for leakage quantification. This approach enables the quantification of both peripheral ($Q{_g}$) and through-mask leakages ($Q{_m}$)
