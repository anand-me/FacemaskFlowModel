
channel_36.fig, channel_48.fig, and channel_56.fig are the final version of the plot shown in paper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To mimic or recreate the plot
 channel_36 folder>> run --> channel_plot_case_36.m 
                             ==> plot the channels around the periphery of the mask
to deploy the face on background now run ==>  face_deployment.m
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
same approach for case with 48 and 56 channels
