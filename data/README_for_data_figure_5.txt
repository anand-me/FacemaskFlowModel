This dataset corresponds to exhale flux penetrating through the mask fabric for different values of ck 100,500, and  1000(kg/m^2 Ã— s) 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To mimic or recreate the plot
  run --> plot_figures_5abc.m 
                             ==> plots the figure 5a, 5b and 5c as in manuscript
  run --> plot_figures_5def.m 
                             ==> plots the figure 5d, 5e and 5f as in manuscript
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
